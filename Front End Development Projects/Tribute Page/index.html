			<p>Aristotle, whose name means "the best purpose", was born in 384 BC in Stagira, Chalcidice, 
				about 55 km (34 miles) east of modern-day Thessaloniki. His father Nicomachus was the personal 
				physician to King Amyntas of Macedon.</p>
			<p>At about the age of eighteen, Aristotle moved to Athens to continue his education at Plato's 
				Academy. He remained there for nearly twenty years before leaving Athens in 348/47 BC.</p>
			<p>Aristotle was invited by Philip II of Macedon to become the tutor to his son Alexander in 343 BC.
				Aristotle was appointed as the head of the royal academy of Macedon. During that time he gave 
				lessons not only to Alexander, but also to two other future kings: Ptolemy and Cassander.</p>
			<p>By 335 BC, Artistotle had returned to Athens, establishing his own school there known as the Lyceum. 
				Aristotle conducted courses at the school for the next twelve years. This period in Athens, between 
				335 and 323 BC, is when Aristotle is believed to have composed many of his works. He wrote many 
				dialogues of which only fragments have survived.</p>
			<p>Following Alexander's death, anti-Macedonian sentiment in Athens was rekindled. In 322 BC, Demophilus 
				and Eurymedon the Hierophant reportedly denounced Aristotle for impiety, prompting him to flee to 
				his mother's family estate in Chalcis, at which occasion he was said to have stated: "I will not allow 
				the Athenians to sin twice against philosophy" â€“ a reference to Athens's prior trial and execution 
				of Socrates. He died in Euboea of natural causes later that same year</p>

			<p>Aristotle not only studied almost every subject possible at the time, but made significant contributions 
				to most of them. His combined works constitute a virtual encyclopedia of Greek knowledge.</p>
